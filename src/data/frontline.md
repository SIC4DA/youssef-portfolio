## Overview

Frontline is a sales deal management platform that replaces long, error prone forms with an AI enhanced conversational interface. It helps sales reps capture, share, and manage deal data faster and more reliably, turning a redundant form workflow into an fast, enjoyable conversational experience.

## My role

I was the **Frontend Developer**, I implemented the UI and client side architecture: from component design and state management to integrating the Vercel AI SDK and optimizing real time data flows.

## Key contributions & features I built

- **AI powered chat interface:** Implemented the conversational UI that accepts natural language deal inputs, parses them into structured deal objects.
- **State & sync at scale:** Scaled client state with **Zustand** and used **React Query** for server state — delivering near instant UX interactions.
- **Reliable parsing:** Integrated **Vercel AI SDK** into chat components to process user input; tuned prompts and client side validation to maintain **>95% accuracy** in extracting deal fields.
- **Collaboration & Shareability:** Built shareable deal page so reps can show off their work & collaborations easily, you can check out how the closed deal page looks like from [here](https://frontline-app.vercel.app/mock-deal).


## Impact

- **4× faster data capture** compared to legacy form workflows (measured in average time-to-complete a deal entry).
- **>95% parsing accuracy** for critical deal fields after prompt + validation improvements.
