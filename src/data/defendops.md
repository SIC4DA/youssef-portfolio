## Overview

DefendOps is a vulnerability management and security assessment platform that helps companies discover, monitor, and remediate vulnerabilities across public and internal assets. The product centralizes scan results, integrations, and remediation workflows so security teams can act faster and more confidently.

## My role

As the **Frontend Developer**, I implemented core UI flows and dashboards, integrated error monitoring, collaborated on design sprints, and optimized data fetching for large security datasets.

## Key contributions & features I built

- **Dashboards & Workflows** Built dashboards and UI flows for asset & vulnerability management, compliance assessments, and pentest/engagement workflows to help security teams act faster and with more context.
- **Sentry Integration** Integrated **Sentry** to capture and triage client facing errors, cutting time to resolution by **~20%** through improved observability and prioritized alerting.
- **Integrations & Data Import** Implemented integrations and UI for importing scan data from external scanners and data sources, allowing clients to centralize vulnerability data from tools like Tenable, Nessus, and Shodan.
- **Data Fetching & Performance** Streamlined data fetching with optimized cache layers (React Query / axios patterns), pagination, and lazy loading to reduce dashboard load times and improve perceived performance.

## Impact

- Onboarded **10+** companies using DefendOps for vulnerability management and security assessments.
- Improved dashboard performance and perceived responsiveness via optimized caching and lazy loading.
